/**
 * @title SoulaaniCoin (SC)
 * @notice Non-transferable, soulbound governance and yield token for Soulaan Co-op
 * @dev ERC-20-based but with all transfers blocked (soulbound)
 *
 * SC is earned through sanctioned co-op activities:
 * - Paying rent in UC to verified landlords
 * - Spending UC at verified businesses
 * - Community service (e.g., neighborhood cleanup)
 * - Working on Co-op-funded projects
 * - Other approved co-op activities
 *
 * SC is used for:
 * - Voting on proposals and treasury allocation (with 2% voting power cap)
 * - Staking for yield from the Soulaan Wealth Fund
 * - Access to Co-op benefits
 *
 * Membership System (Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain):
 * - On-chain status: NotMember, Active, Suspended, Banned
 * - Only Active members can receive SC
 * - Membership status stored on blockchain (source of truth)
 * - Off-chain databases can query and cache this data
 * - All systems stay in sync by reading from blockchain
 *
 * Activity Tracking:
 * - Tracks total activities and activity types per member
 * - Awards can vary based on activity type and frequency
 * - Activity history is transparent and queryable
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Non-transferable (soulbound to wallet)
 * - Max 2% of total voting power per member (enforced in getVotingPower)
 * - Activity-based: more activities = more earning opportunities
 * - Must be active member to receive SC
 *
 * Roles:
 * - GOVERNANCE_AWARD: Can award SC to members (governance bot/backend)
 * - GOVERNANCE_SLASH: Can slash/reduce SC (for violations)
 * - MEMBER_MANAGER: Can manage member status (add, suspend, ban members)
 * - DEFAULT_ADMIN: Can grant/revoke roles
