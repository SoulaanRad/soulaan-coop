## 1. Prerequisites Setup

### ü§î Privy vs MetaMask - Which Do I Need?

**Important:** There's a difference between **admin wallets** (for deployment) and **user wallets** (for members).

| Tool | Purpose | Who Uses It |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **MetaMask** (or similar) | Deploy contracts, admin tasks | You (developer/admin) |
| **Privy** | Create wallets for co-op members | Your users (members) |

**For deployment (right now):** You need MetaMask or can generate a wallet with code (see options below).

**For your app (later):** You'll use Privy to create wallets for co-op members.

### Option A: Install MetaMask (Recommended for Beginners)

MetaMask is a browser wallet that stores your crypto and lets you interact with blockchains.

1. Go to https://metamask.io/download/
2. Install the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Brave
3. Click "Create a new wallet"
4. **SAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE** - Write it down on paper, never digital!
5. Set a strong password

### Option B: Generate Wallet with Code (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use MetaMask, you can generate a wallet programmatically:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm create-wallet
```

This will:
- Generate a new Ethereum wallet
- Print the address and private key
- Save wallet info to `wallets/` folder (git-ignored)

**After generating:**
1. Copy the private key (without `0x`) to your `.env`
2. Fund the address with test ETH
3. Delete the JSON file after copying to `.env` for security

### Add Base Sepolia Network to MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the network dropdown at the top
3. Click "Add Network" or "Add a network manually"
4. Enter these details:
   - **Network Name:** Base Sepolia
   - **RPC URL:** https://sepolia.base.org
   - **Chain ID:** 84532
   - **Currency Symbol:** ETH
   - **Block Explorer URL:** https://sepolia.basescan.org
5. Click "Save"
6. Switch to Base Sepolia network

---

## 2. Get Your Wallet Ready

### Get Your Private Key

You need your private key to deploy contracts from code.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Your private key is like your bank password. NEVER share it or commit it to GitHub!

**Steps:**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the three dots (‚ãÆ) next to your account name
3. Click "Account details"
4. Click "Show private key"
5. Enter your MetaMask password
6. **Copy the private key** (it's a long string starting with 0x)
7. Save it somewhere secure (we'll add it to `.env` soon)

### Get Your Wallet Address

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click your account name at the top
3. It will copy your address (looks like: `0x1234...5678`)
4. Save this - you'll use it for initial role setup

---

## 3. Get Test ETH

You need test ETH to pay for gas fees when deploying contracts. Test ETH is free and has no real value.

### Method 1: Coinbase Faucet (Easiest)

1. Go to https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet
2. Make sure MetaMask is on Base Sepolia network
3. Click "Connect wallet" and approve
4. Request test ETH
5. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Method 2: Alchemy Faucet

1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
2. Create a free Alchemy account
3. Enter your wallet address
4. Complete any verification (if required)
5. Click "Send Me ETH"

### Verify You Have ETH

1. Open MetaMask
2. Make sure you're on Base Sepolia network
3. You should see a balance like "0.5 ETH"
4. Or check at: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_ADDRESS

**Need more ETH?** You can request from multiple faucets if needed.

---

## 4. Install & Configure

### Install Dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to the contracts package:

```bash
cd packages/contracts
pnpm install
```

This might take a few minutes. It will install Hardhat and all dependencies.

### Set Up Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` in your code editor

3. Fill in the values:

```bash
# Your private key from MetaMask (remove the 0x prefix if present)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here_without_0x

# (Optional) Leave as default or use Alchemy/Infura for better reliability
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org

# Get a free API key from https://basescan.org/apis
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_api_key_here

# For testing, use your own wallet address for both
# (You'll create proper multisig/bot wallets later)
TREASURY_SAFE_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_from_metamask
GOVERNANCE_BOT_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_from_metamask

# Optional
REPORT_GAS=false
```

**How to get BaseScan API Key (for verification):**
1. Go to https://basescan.org/register
2. Create a free account
3. Go to https://basescan.org/myapikey
4. Click "Add" to create a new API key
5. Copy the key and paste it in your `.env`

### Compile Contracts

Before deploying, let's make sure everything compiles:

```bash
pnpm compile
```

You should see:
```
Compiled 15 Solidity files successfully
```

If you get errors, check that you ran `pnpm install` first.

---

## 5. Deploy Contracts

Now for the exciting part - deploying your contracts!

### Run Deployment

```bash
pnpm deploy:sepolia
```

### What Happens:

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Connect to Base Sepolia
2. ‚úÖ Check your account has enough ETH
3. ‚úÖ Deploy UnityCoin (UC)
4. ‚úÖ Deploy SoulaaniCoin (SC)
5. ‚úÖ Deploy RedemptionVault
6. ‚úÖ Set up role assignments
7. ‚úÖ Save deployment info to `deployments/` folder
8. ‚úÖ Print contract addresses

### Expected Output:

```
üöÄ Starting Soulaan Co-op Contract Deployment...

üìù Deploying contracts with account: 0x1234...5678
üí∞ Account balance: 0.5 ETH

1Ô∏è‚É£  Deploying UnityCoin (UC)...
‚úÖ UnityCoin deployed to: 0xabcd...

2Ô∏è‚É£  Deploying SoulaaniCoin (SC)...
‚úÖ SoulaaniCoin deployed to: 0xefgh...

3Ô∏è‚É£  Deploying RedemptionVault...
‚úÖ RedemptionVault deployed to: 0xijkl...

üéâ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!

üìã DEPLOYED CONTRACT ADDRESSES:
UnityCoin (UC):       0xabcd...
SoulaaniCoin (SC):    0xefgh...
RedemptionVault:      0xijkl...
```

**üéâ Congratulations! You just deployed smart contracts!**

### Save Your Contract Addresses

**VERY IMPORTANT:** Copy these three addresses somewhere safe:
- UnityCoin (UC) address
- SoulaaniCoin (SC) address
- RedemptionVault address

You'll need them to integrate with your backend.

---

## 6. Verify Contracts

Contract verification makes your code publicly visible on BaseScan, which builds trust.

### Run Verification

```bash
pnpm verify:sepolia
```

This will take 1-2 minutes per contract.

### Expected Output:

```
üîç Starting contract verification...

1Ô∏è‚É£  Verifying UnityCoin...
‚úÖ UnityCoin verified!

2Ô∏è‚É£  Verifying SoulaaniCoin...
‚úÖ SoulaaniCoin verified!

3Ô∏è‚É£  Verifying RedemptionVault...
‚úÖ RedemptionVault verified!

üéâ Verification process complete!
```

### View Your Contracts on BaseScan

Open the URLs printed in the output (or construct them):
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_UC_ADDRESS
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_SC_ADDRESS
- https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_VAULT_ADDRESS

You should see:
- Green checkmark ‚úÖ next to "Contract"
- "Read Contract" and "Write Contract" tabs
- Your full Solidity source code

---

## 7. What's Next?

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Save deployment info**
   - Contract addresses are in `deployments/baseSepolia-[timestamp].json`
   - Back this file up somewhere safe

2. **Test your contracts**
   - Go to BaseScan
   - Try "Read Contract" functions (like `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf()`)
   - Try "Write Contract" functions (like `mint()` - connect MetaMask first)

3. **Integrate with your backend**
   - Add contract addresses to your API `.env`:
     ```bash
     UC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xabcd...
     SC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xefgh...
     VAULT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xijkl...
     ```

### Setting Up Proper Roles (Production-Ready)

Right now, your personal wallet has all the roles. For production, you should:

#### 1. Create Treasury Safe (Multisig)

1. Go to https://safe.global
2. Click "Create Account"
3. Choose Base Sepolia network
4. Add signers (e.g., 3 trusted people)
5. Set threshold (e.g., 2 out of 3 must approve)
6. Deploy the Safe
7. Copy the Safe address

#### 2. Create Governance Bot Wallet

This is a wallet your backend server will control.

**Using ethers.js in your backend:**
```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Generate a new wallet
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();

console.log('Address:', wallet.address);
console.log('Private Key:', wallet.privateKey);

// Save the private key in your backend .env
// Fund this wallet with ~0.1 ETH for gas fees
```

#### 3. Transfer Roles to Proper Addresses

Once you have your Treasury Safe and Governance Bot addresses:

**Option A: Using BaseScan (GUI)**
1. Go to your UC contract on BaseScan
2. Click "Write Contract" ‚Üí "Connect Wallet"
3. Find `grantRole` function
4. For TREASURER_MINT role:
   - role: `0x... (keccak256("TREASURER_MINT"))`
   - account: Your Treasury Safe address
5. Submit transaction

**Option B: Write a script (advanced)**

Create `scripts/transfer-roles.ts`:
```typescript
// Grant roles to proper addresses
await unityCoin.grantRole(TREASURER_MINT, treasurySafeAddress);
await unityCoin.grantRole(PAUSER, treasurySafeAddress);

// Renounce your own roles
await unityCoin.renounceRole(TREASURER_MINT, deployerAddress);
await unityCoin.renounceRole(PAUSER, deployerAddress);
```

### Setting Up Instant Onramps (Critical!)

See **QUICK_START.md** for detailed setup of the `ONRAMP_MINTER` role, which allows your backend to mint UC instantly up to a daily limit. This is **essential for good UX** - without it, every onramp requires 3 board signatures (hours of delay).

**Quick summary:**
1. Create an onramp wallet for your backend
2. Grant it `ONRAMP_MINTER` role
3. Set daily limit (e.g., 50,000 UC/day)
4. Backend mints UC instantly when users deposit

**Result:** Users get UC in 5 seconds instead of hours!

### Integrating with Your Backend

See the main project README for:
- Event monitoring (listen for SC award triggers)
- Transaction submission (award SC, process redemptions)
- Privy wallet integration

## 8. Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Insufficient funds for intrinsic transaction cost"

**Problem:** You don't have enough test ETH.

**Solution:** Get more test ETH from the faucets (see Section 3).

---

### ‚ùå "Invalid nonce" or "Transaction already imported"

**Problem:** Network is processing a previous transaction.

**Solution:** Wait 10-20 seconds and try again.

---

### ‚ùå "Missing required environment variable"

**Problem:** Your `.env` file is incomplete.

**Solution:** 
- Make sure you copied `env.example` to `.env`
- Fill in all required values
- Check there are no spaces around `=` signs

---

### ‚ùå "Network baseSepolia not found"

**Problem:** Hardhat can't find the network configuration.

**Solution:**
- Check `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` in `.env`
- Try the default: `https://sepolia.base.org`
- Or get a free RPC from Alchemy/Infura

---

### ‚ùå "Contract verification failed: Invalid API Key"

**Problem:** Your BaseScan API key is wrong or missing.

**Solution:**
- Get a free API key from https://basescan.org/apis
- Add it to `.env` as `BASESCAN_API_KEY`

---

### ‚ùå "Error: could not detect network"

**Problem:** RPC endpoint is not responding.

**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different RPC (Alchemy, Infura, or QuickNode)
- Wait a few minutes and try again

---

### ‚ùå Contracts deployed but verification fails

**Problem:** BaseScan might be slow or API key issue.

**Solution:**
- Wait 5 minutes and run `pnpm verify:sepolia` again
- Verify manually on BaseScan:
  1. Go to your contract address
  2. Click "Contract" tab
  3. Click "Verify and Publish"
  4. Fill in the form with your contract details

---
