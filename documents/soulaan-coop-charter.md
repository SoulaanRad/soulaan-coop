**Version 2.1 ‚Äì Founding Constitution for the Black Sovereign Economy**

## **‚úä Purpose**

Soulaan Co-op exists to rebuild the economic sovereignty of Black Americans by:

1. **Increasing internal investment** in productive assets, labor, and ownership
2. **Expanding exports** of Black-created goods, services, and intellectual property
3. **Transforming rent, consumption, and labor into long-term equity and governance**
4. **Circulating capital within the Black economy, limiting extractive leakage**

All Soulaan Co-op actions and rules must serve this mission. Any policy, vote, or contract that deviates from it may be nullified by governance vote or AI Charter Guardian review.

- Proposals must be:
    1. **Export-Earning:** Brings in outside capital, shows revenue in 12‚Äì24 months.
    2. **Import-Reducing:** Lowers costs, keeps UC inside community.
    3. **Productive Investment:** Builds capacity, jobs, or output in 18‚Äì36 months.
- **85%+ of spending must be in these categories; max 15% for non-ROI (events, education, media).**
