# üß† The Soulaan Proposal Engine

### A Framework for Automated Economic Coordination and Collective Governance

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Soulaan Proposal Engine** serves as the decision-making and coordination core of the **Soulaan Co-op**, aligning individual initiative with collective prosperity. It enables members to propose, evaluate, and fund projects that grow local wealth, reduce economic leakage, and strengthen self-reliance. By combining cooperative governance, AI evaluation, and transparent accounting, it transforms economic decision-making into a scalable, accountable, and data-driven process.

---

## 2. Core Purpose

The Proposal Engine‚Äôs purpose is to:
- Evaluate proposals based on measurable impact to community GDP and collective wealth.
- Prioritize projects that reduce economic leakage (import substitution).
- Automate fairness, transparency, and accountability using AI models.
- Encourage collaboration rather than duplication of resources.

---

## 3. Architectural Layers

### 3.1 Submission Layer
Members submit structured proposals including budget, goals, timeline, and expected community benefits. The system parses this into a standardized **Proposal Object**.

### 3.2 Evaluation Layer
AI evaluates proposals against five pillars:
1. Economic Self-Reliance (Import Substitution)
2. Community Employment & Skills Development
3. Collective Ownership & Asset Growth
4. Transparency & Governance Compliance
5. Cultural & Educational Value

### 3.3 Coordination Layer
This layer prevents redundancy by:
- Detecting similar proposals.
- Measuring category saturation (e.g., too many food classes).
- Recommending mergers or category shifts.

### 3.4 Governance Layer
Approval tiers:
- **Auto-approval:** low-risk, low-cost proposals.
- **Member Vote:** medium-scale projects.
- **Board Review:** large or strategic infrastructure.

## 4. Scoring Framework

| Criterion | Weight | Example Question |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| Economic Self-Reliance | 25% | Does it replace imported goods/services? |
| Community Jobs | 25% | How many stable jobs per UC invested? |
| Asset Retention | 20% | Does the co-op gain lasting ownership? |
| Transparency | 15% | Can members track results publicly? |
| Cultural Value | 15% | Does it strengthen local identity or skills? |

Scores are averaged; proposals under a minimum threshold (e.g., 6.5/10) are rejected or redirected.

---

## 5. Category Management

To prevent dilution:
- Proposals are auto-tagged by category (Food, Retail, Services, Housing, Logistics, etc.).
- AI monitors over-saturation per region and deprioritizes excess.
- Members are encouraged to merge projects or co-own assets.
- SC/UC rewards increase for underserved categories.

---

## 6. Funding Flow & Feedback Loop

1. Approved proposals receive UC or access to co-op assets.
2. A portion of revenue automatically returns to the co-op treasury.
3. Proposal outcomes (profit, jobs, engagement) feed into future scoring.
4. Successful members earn **Reputation Credits** improving their future proposal weight.

---

## 7. Transparency Integration

Every action in the Engine is recorded on the **Soulaan Transparency Dashboard**:
- Proposal list and funding stage.
- Treasury allocations per sector.
- Vote outcomes and transaction receipts.
- Community metrics (GDP growth, SC/UC circulation, jobs created).

## 9. Risk Controls

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Duplication | Too many similar projects | Category monitoring + AI merge suggestions |
| Capture | Influential members dominate | Rotation + transparency + capped voting power |
| Misuse of Funds | Poor tracking | Ledger-based disbursement + receipts required |
| Mission Drift | Off-mission projects | AI scoring aligned to co-op constitution |

---

## 10. Adaptive Proposal Refinement

The Proposal Engine does more than approve or reject ‚Äî it actively improves ideas. When a proposal is submitted, the AI layer performs a **gap analysis** and suggests modular additions to increase impact and constitutional alignment.

### Example: Proposal to Buy Single-Family Homes
**Base Idea:** Acquire homes in a Black community for co-op ownership and local rental.

**AI Recommendations:**
1. **Add a Workforce or Apprenticeship Component**  
   Train co-op members in maintenance, plumbing, or carpentry to create jobs.
2. **Include a Lease-to-Own Pathway**  
   Allow long-term tenants to purchase equity shares after 5 years.
3. **Integrate Green Energy Retrofits**  
   Add solar or insulation upgrades for lower utility leakage.
4. **Add Micro-Business Overlay**  
   Reserve one home for a daycare, tutoring space, or co-op office.
5. **Create a Community Reinvestment Clause**  
   Dedicate 10% of net rent into a local education or emergency fund.

### Adaptive Workflow
```
[Submit Proposal]
      ‚Üì
[AI Evaluation + Scoring]
      ‚Üì
[Gap Analysis Engine]
      ‚Üì
‚Üí Identifies Weak Areas (jobs, transparency, equity)
      ‚Üì
‚Üí Suggests Modular Additions (training, green energy, social fund)
      ‚Üì
[Member Reviews + Edits]
      ‚Üì
[Final Evaluation + Approval]
```

### Incentive Design
- Proposals adopting enhancement suggestions receive higher SC rewards.
- Faster approval queues for multi-benefit designs.
- Visibility boost on the Transparency Dashboard.

### Outcome Example
> Revised housing proposal with green upgrades and workforce training scores **9.1/10**, achieving higher community impact and alignment.

## 11. Collective Safeguards and Feedback Governance

The Proposal Engine also ensures that projects cannot devolve into private capture or low-impact spending. It integrates intelligent safeguards and structured feedback from trusted reviewers.

### Intelligent Suggestion Principles
To avoid personal enrichment projects, AI applies **density, shared use, and collective ownership checks** before approval.

**Density and Shared Utility Checks**  
- Does the proposal create multi-household or multi-enterprise benefits?  
- Can the design integrate mixed-use (housing + business + green space)?  
- Are revenues shared with the co-op treasury?  

If not, the engine suggests alternatives like:  
> ‚ÄúConvert single-family acquisition into a **mixed-use micro-block** with shared courtyard, retail space, and community garden.‚Äù

**Collective Benefit Guardrails**  
Projects must meet a **Collective Return Ratio** ‚Äî at least 60% of economic benefit must return to members through UC flow, employment, or shared services. Proposals below this threshold are sent back for redesign.

---

### Structured Comment and Reevaluation Cycle

**Comment Layer**  
After AI scoring, the proposal enters a review phase visible to:  
- Board members  
- Subject matter experts  
- Trusted community reviewers  

Comments are categorized as: ‚úÖ Endorsement / ‚ö†Ô∏è Suggestion / ‚ùå Critical Issue. The AI aggregates sentiment and adjusts scores accordingly.

**Revision Cycle**  
Proposers revise based on comments and resubmit. All changes are logged on the Transparency Dashboard.

**Weighted Reviewer Credibility**  
Trusted reviewers hold higher reputation weights; their comments influence reevaluation more strongly. All weights are public to maintain accountability.

**Final Reevaluation**  
Once revisions are complete, the AI reevaluates the improved proposal, restoring points for addressed issues and updating its composite score.

## 13. Conclusion

The **Soulaan Proposal Engine** operationalizes cooperative sovereignty. It ensures that each UC spent builds collective wealth, each proposal contributes to measurable GDP growth, and every member has a visible stake in the process. With built-in collective safeguards, adaptive feedback, and density-aware AI logic, the system avoids personal capture and drives coordinated, high-impact development.  

By merging AI governance, human review, and economic transparency, the Proposal Engine transforms community ideas into shared infrastructure ‚Äî ensuring Black and disenfranchised communities move from survival to structural prosperity.
