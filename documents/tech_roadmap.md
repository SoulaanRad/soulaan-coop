# 📱 Soulaan Co-op App Roadmap

## Step 1 — Foundation
- Define the Co-op’s mission, membership rules, and governance basics (from the charter).  
- Choose the chain + wallet system (smart wallet or custodial) for SC and UC.  
- Set up authentication (Privy) and database structure.  

---

## Step 2 — Core Transactions
- Build UC stablecoin wallet integration.  
- Enable peer-to-peer transfers between members.  
- Implement transaction fee capture (5–10%) for the Co-op treasury.  

---

## Step 3 — Membership & Identity
- Add member profiles (basic info, business affiliation, region).  
- Issue membership badges/tokens tied to wallets.  
- Build onboarding flow for individuals and businesses.  

---

## Step 4 — Business Integration
- Create merchant tools:  
  - Accept UC for payments.  
  - Simple UC → SC conversion payouts.  
- Add an in-app directory of Soulaan businesses.  

---

## Step 5 — Governance & Proposals
- Launch proposal engine:  
  - Members suggest projects and business funding.  
  - AI-assisted review ensures alignment with Co-op rules.  
- Implement simple voting for treasury allocation.  

---

## Step 6 — Rewards & Incentives
- Members earn SC equity shares:  
  - For every transaction.  
  - For governance participation.  
- AI safeguards prevent “whale capture” (equity concentration caps).  

---

## Step 7 — Expansion & Network Effects
- Add community features:  
  - In-app discussions (structured, not noisy).  
  - Business reviews and trust signals.  
- Build APIs for anchor institutions (schools, hospitals, suppliers) to source from Co-op businesses.
