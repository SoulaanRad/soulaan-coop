RECENTLY COMPLETED ITEMS:
- ${completedText}

RECENT CODE CHANGES (for context):
${changesText}

Based on the completed roadmap items and recent changes, suggest specific technical sub-items that should be added to remaining roadmap items. Focus on:

1. **Technical implementation gaps** revealed by the completed work
2. **Integration requirements** now needed between completed and remaining items
3. **Testing and validation** requirements for the completed functionality
4. **Documentation and monitoring** needs that emerged
5. **Performance and security** considerations now relevant

Be specific and technical. Suggest actionable sub-items that are obvious next steps given what was just completed.

For example, if "Set up authentication" was completed, you might suggest:
- Add authentication middleware to API routes
- Implement user session management
- Add authentication error handling
- Create user authentication tests

Focus on sub-items for roadmap steps that haven't been completed yet, but now have new requirements due to the completed work.`;
