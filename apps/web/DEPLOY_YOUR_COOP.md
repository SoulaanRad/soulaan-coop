Each step shows:
- Real-time status
- Transaction hash (click to view on BaseScan)
- Contract address (click to copy)

### Phase 4: Complete & Download

**Your co-op is now live!** It's registered in the database and visible in the mobile app.

Download two files:

1. **JSON Config** - Full deployment record
   - All contract addresses
   - All configuration settings
   - Deployment metadata
   - Keep this for your records!

2. **.env File** - Ready for your backend

- Check you have enough ETH
- Increase gas limit if needed
- Wait and try again

### Deployment stuck
- Check transaction on BaseScan
- May need to wait for network congestion
- Can resume from failed step

### Can't download files
- Check browser popup blocker
- Try different browser
- Copy addresses manually

## Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Use multisig Safe for production treasury
- Generate dedicated governance bot wallet
- Test on testnet first
- Back up configuration files
- Verify contracts on BaseScan

### ❌ DON'T
- Use personal wallet as treasury on mainnet
- Share private keys
- Commit .env files to git
- Skip testnet testing
- Deploy without backup plan
